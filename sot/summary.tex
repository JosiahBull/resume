\cvsection{Summary}


\begin{cvparagraph}
Currently a network engineer at start-up company Sylo. I am responsible for DIANA, a discord bot designed to assign roles based on owned assets. I specialize in backend infrastructure, particularly REST api's and decentralized programming. In my free time I enjoy tinkering with my homelab, cooking, gaming, and running.

I'm a super nerd who loves Linux, Rust, and customizing the hell out of my development environment. I'm interested in devising unique solutions to problems, that go above and beyond - learning new technologies and tools as the need arises.
